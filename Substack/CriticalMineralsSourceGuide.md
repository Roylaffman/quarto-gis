## Source Quality Guide — Critical Minerals of the Americas

This document explains how to evaluate sources on lithium, rare earth elements, and critical minerals — a field where government agencies, mining companies, environmental groups, and geopolitical actors all publish research with different incentive structures. Source quality matters more here than in most domains.

## Source Quality Tiers

| Tag | Tier | Meaning | Reliability | Watch For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Peer-rev.** | 1 | Published in peer-reviewed academic journals with editorial review and referee process | Highest — methodology is independently verified | Field is new; replication studies are rare. Some journals are faster than others to correct errors. |
| **Gov.** | 2 | Government agency data, publicly audited statistical reports | High for production/reserve statistics; lower for policy projections | USGS data lags 1-2 years. Agencies may reflect administration priorities in framing (e.g. "critical" mineral designations are partly political). |
| **IGO** | 2 | Intergovernmental organization reports (IEA, World Bank, UN) | High for aggregated global data | Modeling assumptions vary significantly. IEA demand projections have historically been conservative. |
| **Gray lit.** | 3 | Think tanks, research institutes, journalism — not peer-reviewed but editorially independent | Moderate — useful for synthesis and policy context | Check funding sources. MIT Climate Lab, RMI, BNEF have different audiences and funders. |
| **NGO/Advocacy** | 3 | Environmental and Indigenous rights organizations | Useful for on-the-ground impact data unavailable elsewhere | Advocacy framing can overstate harms; use for local/qualitative data, cross-check production figures with Gov. sources. |
| **Industry** | 4 | Corporate filings, operator press releases, trade association reports | Low-moderate for factual project specs; low for market projections | Reserve estimates are self-reported. Production forecasts are optimistic. Use for project specs (location, tonnage, ownership) not for market analysis. |
| **Book** | 3 | Long-form journalism and non-fiction (trade/academic press) | Varies by author — good for narrative context and synthesis | May not reflect post-publication developments. Useful for historical context and supply chain narratives. |

### A Note on Critical Minerals Specifically

This topic sits at the intersection of several fields with known biases:

- **Mining companies** have regulatory and investor incentives to overstate reserve quality and understate environmental impact
- **Environmental NGOs** have advocacy incentives to overstate risk; their local and Indigenous community data is often more reliable than their macroeconomic claims
- **Governments** designate minerals as "critical" for strategic reasons that may not align with geological scarcity — the US critical minerals list is partly a trade policy instrument
- **China-related data** is particularly unreliable: Chinese rare earth production and reserve figures are state-managed and have historically been manipulated for trade leverage
- **Consultancies** (Wood Mackenzie, Benchmark Minerals, Roskill) produce the most-cited market data but it sits behind expensive paywalls — free summaries may cherry-pick findings

## How to Regenerate the Static Overview Map

The `static-overview.png` file uses Natural Earth shapefiles downloaded at runtime. If the network request fails (CartoDB or Natural Earth CDN timeout):

1. Run the export script directly: `cd research/analysis && python export_critical_minerals_images.py`
2. The script now uses a local Natural Earth fallback — if `geodatasets` isn't installed, it downloads the 110m countries shapefile from Natural Earth CDN
3. If network is unavailable: install `geodatasets` with `pip install geodatasets` for a fully local dataset
4. Alternative: run just the static map cell in `critical-minerals.qmd` directly in Jupyter and screenshot the inline output
