## What this is

A small docs site that describes how to use the **research templates** and how to keep GIS
visualization work reproducible and consistent.

## Quick links

- [Setup](guides/setup.qmd)
- [GIS Visuals](guides/gis-visuals.qmd)
- [Publishing](guides/publishing.qmd)

## Suggested convention

- Exploratory notebooks live in `research/analysis/`
- Decision-grade outputs live in `research/reports/`
- Reusable modules live in `research/inserts/`
