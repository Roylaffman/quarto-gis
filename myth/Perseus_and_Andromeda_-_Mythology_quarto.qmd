[[Gilgamesh]]

- **Enoch and Ethiopian Christianity:** You're spot on about the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church including the Books of Enoch in their biblical canon. These books, which detail Enoch's experiences and prophecies, were influential in early Jewish and Christian thought but are not part of the standard biblical canon in most other Western Christian denominations. This unique inclusion does highlight Ethiopia's distinct religious heritage and its preservation of ancient texts.
    
- **Queen of Sheba:** The identity of the Queen of Sheba is indeed debated. While the biblical account doesn't explicitly name her kingdom, both Ethiopia and the Sabaean kingdom in ancient Yemen are strong contenders. Their geographical proximity across the Red Sea and historical trade links make both plausible. Ethiopian tradition strongly identifies her as an Ethiopian queen who traveled to Jerusalem to meet King Solomon.
    
- **Perseus and Andromeda:** Your recollection of Perseus marrying Andromeda, an Ethiopian princess (daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia), is correct. This myth is a classic of Greek mythology.
    
- **Perseus and the Persians:** Your etymological musings are interesting! While the Greek hero Perseus is a prominent figure, the connection to the name "Persian" is debated, as you noted. Herodotus's account of Perses being the founder is one explanation, but it's considered by many to be a legendary origin story. The actual origin of the name "Persia" (Old Persian _Pārsa_) is likely related to the name of the region and its people. The Parsi people you mentioned are descendants of Persian Zoroastrians who migrated to India to preserve their religious identity, and their name reflects their origin. So, while there's a historical link between Persia and the Parsi, the connection to the mythological Perseus is less certain and likely more of a cultural association in ancient Greek thought.
    
- **Gilgamesh as a Foundation Story and Parables:** You're making a very insightful point about the potential influence of the Epic of Gilgamesh on later foundation myths like that of Perseus. Given the interconnectedness of ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean cultures, the exchange of stories and narrative structures is highly probable. Gilgamesh, with its themes of heroism, kingship, mortality, and encounters with the divine, certainly provides a rich template for later heroic narratives.
    
    Your question about parables in Perseus is intriguing. While not explicitly framed as parables in the way the stories of Jesus are, ancient myths often contain symbolic meanings and can be interpreted on multiple levels. The challenges Perseus faces, his interactions with gods and monsters, and his eventual triumph can be seen as allegorical representations of human struggles, virtues, and the establishment of order.
    
- **Perseus, Andromeda, and Ancient Greek Perceptions of Ethnicity:** This is a particularly thought-provoking question! The idea that the marriage of a European (Greek) hero to an African (Ethiopian) princess might represent an ancient Greek understanding of the origins of Arabic people is a fascinating hypothesis.
    
    Here's why it's complex and requires some nuance:
    
    - **Ancient Greek Understanding of Geography and Ethnicity:** Ancient Greek knowledge of geography and the distinctions between various African and Middle Eastern peoples wasn't always precise by modern standards. "Ethiopia" was often a broader term referring to the darker-skinned peoples of Africa south of Egypt. Their understanding of the Arabian Peninsula and its inhabitants was also evolving.
    - **Myth as Symbolic Representation:** Myths often serve symbolic purposes beyond literal historical or ethnic representation. The marriage of Perseus and Andromeda could symbolize the union of different cultures or regions, the overcoming of foreign threats (Andromeda is rescued from a sea monster), or even broader cosmological themes.
    - **Evolution of Ethnic Categories:** The concept of distinct "European," "African," and "Arabic" identities as we understand them today is a product of historical development and doesn't perfectly map onto ancient perceptions.
    
    While it's tempting to draw a direct line between this myth and a proto-understanding of Arabic origins, it's more likely that the story reflects a broader engagement with and perception of "the other" – in this case, a powerful and perhaps somewhat exoticized African kingdom. The Greeks certainly had interactions with various peoples of North Africa and the Near East, and these encounters likely shaped their mythology.
    
    It's a fantastic question that highlights how myths can offer glimpses into ancient worldviews, even if those glimpses are filtered through layers of symbolism and evolving understanding.



# Original Idea 
Johns post 
Anyways, was thinking about how the only major Christian denomination that includes the story of Enoch are the Ethiopian Christians.

But that got me thinking about how Ethiopia is kind of important in several ancient cultures.

I might be wrong, but I think several scholars think that the Queen of Sheba might be referring to Ethiopia (but also might be Yemen, but they’re also like right across from each other). And then in the story of Perseus (side stoned thought, suddenly thought Perseus might mean “From Zeus”, but that wasn’t a suggestion included in the etymology section of Wikipedia… but this whole post is also kind of an etymology thing too btw… maybe should have said that sooner… ![🤷‍♂️](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/te5/1/16/1f937_200d_2642.png)) has him marrying Andromeda, an Ethiopian princess.

And then I was like, wait a minute here (btw, thank god for autocorrect right now…), is Perseus where the name for the Persians came from!?

And, maybe?

Herodotus said so, claiming that the Persian empire was founded by Perses son of Perseus and Andromeda. But then that might be apocryphal because there’s a group of people who were/are called the Parsi that are supposed to have founded the Persian empire. So, unlike other names of countries/cultures we have in the English language, that’s what they actually called themselves. Except they hit that E with a hard A. Parsian Empire. lol.

But then!! Then I was like, wait a goddamn, finger-licking, what the fucking minute! Gilgamesh (ARE YOU SURPRISED???) isn’t just a story, it’s also full of a bunch of parables. And, it’s also a foundation story just like Perseus. And, Greeks studied under Egyptians, Egyptians studied under the Sumerians, they all kind of learned storytelling from each other (among other things), the writers of Perseus were probably familiar with Gilgamesh and used it as a model for their foundation storytelling and Perseus is one of the older known Greek stories.

There’s probably a few parables in Perseus.

Like, where are all of these statues coming from?

But then I was like, WAIT YET ANOTHER FREAKAFUCKA MINUTE. Does Perseus marry Andromeda, again a princess of Ethiopia, because ancient Greeks thought that European + African = Arabic?
