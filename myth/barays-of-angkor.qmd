## Introduction

The Angkor Archaeological Park in northwest Cambodia — a UNESCO World Heritage Site covering over 400 square kilometers — contains some of the most ambitious hydraulic engineering achievements of the pre-industrial world. Among these, the **barays** (massive artificial reservoirs) stand as enduring testimony to the organizational capacity, engineering sophistication, and cosmological vision of the Khmer Empire (9th–15th century CE).

This report focuses on the two largest barays at Angkor: the **East Baray** (Yashodharatataka) and the **West Baray** (Baray Teuk Thla). Together they represent over two centuries of evolving water management strategy, a system that sustained one of the most populous pre-industrial cities on Earth — estimated at up to one million inhabitants at its peak.

The barays were not simply utilitarian reservoirs. They were deeply embedded in Hindu-Buddhist cosmology, symbolizing the primordial oceans surrounding Mount Meru, the mythical home of the gods. Temples built on artificial islands at their centers reinforced this sacred geography. Understanding the barays requires reading them as both engineering marvels and spiritual landscapes.

---

## The East Baray (Yashodharatataka)

### Historical Context

The East Baray was constructed around **900 CE** during the reign of **King Yasovarman I**, who also founded the capital of Yashodharapura. It was the second major baray built in the Angkor region, following the smaller Indratataka at Roluos (completed 889 CE, measuring 3.8 km × 880 m). The East Baray was originally called **Yashodharatataka** after its royal patron.

Yasovarman moved the capital from Hariharalaya (near modern Roluos) northward to the area that would become Angkor. The East Baray was built to guarantee a regular water supply for this new city. It was fed by the **Siem Reap River**, which flows south from the Kulen Hills — the sacred mountain range where Jayavarman II had declared Khmer independence in 802 CE.

Inscription stones marking the construction have been found at all four corners of the reservoir, documenting its creation and consecration.

### Physical Dimensions

<div class="coordinate-box">
**Approximate Center:** 13.434°N, 103.926°E<br>
**Orientation:** East–West<br>
**Dimensions:** ~7.5 km × 1.83 km (4.6 mi × 1.1 mi)<br>
**Capacity:** ~50–55 million m³ of water<br>
**Dike Fill Volume:** ~8 million m³ of earth
</div>

The labor required for its construction was staggering. The embankment dikes alone contain approximately 8 million cubic meters of fill — moved and compacted entirely by human labor. The baray was created by diverting and containing the natural flow of water across the Angkor plain using massive earthen embankments.

### The East Mebon Temple

At the center of the East Baray stands the **East Mebon**, a 10th-century Hindu temple built in **953 CE** by the architect and guru **Kavindrarimathana**, Buddhist minister of **King Rajendravarman II**. An inscription records the exact dedication: Friday, 28 January 953, at 11 AM.

The temple was built on an artificial island of approximately 120 meters across and was originally accessible only by boat. It features a classic "temple-mountain" form symbolizing Mount Meru, with a three-meter-high central platform carrying a quincunx of towers. Laterite landing platforms flanked by guardian lions mark where boats would have docked — there are notably no stone stairs to the current ground level, since visitors arrived by water.

The main entry pavilion of the Royal Palace and the Victory Gate of Angkor Thom were later aligned along the same east-west axis as the East Mebon, indicating its enduring importance in Angkorian urban planning.

### Current Status

The East Baray is **completely dry today**. Farmers cultivate rice and other crops on its bed. However, its rectangular outlines remain clearly visible in satellite imagery and aerial photographs — the earthen embankments persist as elevated ridges across the landscape. The East Mebon now rises from rice paddies rather than water.

On the eastern side, a large laterite structure called **Krol Romeas** served as an outlet or inlet depending on the season. On the western bank, a large sandstone and laterite terrace — cruciform in layout — once had steps leading down to the water's edge, with ornate lion statues at the waterline.

---

## The West Baray (Baray Teuk Thla)

### Historical Context

The West Baray was constructed beginning in the **early 11th century** under **King Suryavarman I** and completed during the reign of his successor **King Udayadityavarman II**. It was built because the earlier East Baray could no longer reliably support the expanding Angkor Empire's water needs.

The West Baray was fed by two main water sources: the **Siem Reap River** and the **Puok River**. Its construction incorporated, destroyed, or submerged earlier sites:

- The **east dike** largely reused a section of the dike that had enclosed Yasovarman's capital city (centered on Phnom Bakheng temple)
- The **south dike** partially buried the brick pyramid temple **Ak Yum** (dating to the 8th century or earlier)
- The **western floor** had been inhabited — archaeological work uncovered wall bases, steps, and pottery shards, along with a stele inscription from 713 CE describing rice fields offered to Queen Jayadevi

### Physical Dimensions

<div class="coordinate-box">
**Approximate Center:** 13.414°N, 103.814°E<br>
**Orientation:** East–West<br>
**Dimensions:** ~7.8 km × 2.1 km (4.8 mi × 1.3 mi)<br>
**Maximum Capacity:** ~53 million m³ (~14 billion US gallons)<br>
**Dike Height:** up to 11.9 meters
</div>

The West Baray is the **largest baray at Angkor** and one of the largest hand-excavated reservoirs on Earth. Its perfectly rectangular form, oriented precisely east-west, reflects both engineering precision and cosmological intent.

### The West Mebon Temple

The **West Mebon** is a Hindu temple constructed on an artificial island at the center of the baray by Udayadityavarman II. It shares architectural characteristics with the **Baphuon** temple at Angkor Thom.

The most significant find at the West Mebon was a large **bronze statue of Vishnu Reclining** (Vishnu Anantashayin), now exhibited at the **National Museum of Cambodia** in Phnom Penh. This iconography — Vishnu resting on the cosmic ocean — perfectly aligns with the baray-as-cosmic-ocean symbolism central to Angkorian cosmology.

### Current Status

The West Baray **still holds water today**, particularly in its western end, where water persists year-round. During the rainy season, water advances eastward to fill most of the reservoir. A modern irrigation lock installed in the southern dike raises the water level and provides water to agricultural fields to the south.

Today the baray serves as a popular local recreation site — residents of Siem Reap visit for swimming, boat rides, and picnics. It has even been used as a landing site for seaplanes. The West Mebon temple is accessible by boat in the wet season and on foot during the dry season when water levels recede.

## The Hydraulic System in Context

The barays did not operate in isolation. They were nodes in an interconnected hydraulic network of canals, moats, embankments, and smaller reservoirs (called *srang*) that managed water across the entire Angkor plain.

### The Four Major Barays of Angkor

Chronologically, the four great barays are:

1. **Indratataka** (889 CE) — 3.8 km × 880 m — at Roluos, now dry; temple: Lolei
2. **East Baray / Yashodharatataka** (~900 CE) — 7.5 km × 1.83 km — now dry; temple: East Mebon
3. **West Baray / Baray Teuk Thla** (~11th c.) — 7.8 km × 2.1 km — still holds water; temple: West Mebon
4. **Jayatataka / North Baray** (late 12th c.) — ~3.5 km × 900 m — nearly dry/seasonal; temple: Neak Pean

### Water Management Functions

All barays received water at their northeastern corners (a consistent design pattern). The system served multiple purposes:

- **Groundwater recharge** — all barays helped maintain the water table through direct infiltration
- **Irrigation** — the West Baray, Indratataka, and (initially) East Baray supplied canals feeding rice paddies
- **Urban water supply** — the Jayatataka/North Baray supplied Angkor Thom city
- **Flood control** — the natural slope of the terrain allowed overflow toward Tonlé Sap Lake
- **Religious/political symbolism** — water legitimized royal authority and connected the earthly realm to cosmic geography

### Decline and Collapse

Research, including paleoenvironmental analysis of sediment cores from the West Baray (published in PNAS), indicates that the hydraulic system was actively managed from its construction through the 13th century. In the 14th century, sedimentation rates dropped dramatically — correlating with severe monsoon failures recorded in Vietnamese tree-ring data.

By the late 14th century, Angkor suffered alternating droughts and catastrophic flooding over several consecutive years. Canals became blocked by debris from collapsing structures. The cascade of infrastructure failure contributed to the decline of the Khmer Empire, culminating in the Siamese invasion of 1430.

## Digitizing Tip
The barays are large enough to be clearly visible in Sentinel-2 imagery (10m resolution). For precise boundary digitization, use Google Earth Pro's historical imagery slider to find cloud-free dates. The West Baray is especially easy to identify due to its retained water. The dry East Baray is best visible in dry-season imagery (November–April) when crop patterns on its bed contrast with surrounding terrain.
:::

---

## Recommended Workflow for Story Map

### Data Acquisition

1. **Download Sentinel-2 imagery** from Copernicus Browser for the Angkor region (tile T48PUV covers the area). Select cloud-free images from the dry season for best visibility of both barays.
2. **Download Cambodia OSM data** from Geofabrik (roads, waterways, buildings layers).
3. **Download SRTM DEM** from EarthExplorer for elevation context (the barays' embankments are visible in DEM data).
4. **Extract baray polygons** from OSM using QuickOSM in QGIS (search for `natural=water` and `name=West Baray` or `name=East Baray`) or digitize from imagery.

### Processing in ArcGIS Pro / QGIS

1. Project all layers to **WGS 84 / UTM Zone 48N (EPSG:32648)** — the appropriate projected CRS for this area of Cambodia.
2. Clip imagery and vector layers to the Angkor study area.
3. Create custom polygon features for each baray if not available in OSM.
4. Build attribute tables with historical metadata (construction dates, kings, dimensions, temple names).
5. Generate hillshade from SRTM DEM to visualize embankment topography.

### Quarto Story Map Assembly

For a Leaflet-based interactive map in Quarto, consider using the `{leaflet}` R package or Python's `folium` library:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: show

library(leaflet)
library(sf)

# Define baray extents as simple rectangles
west_baray <- st_polygon(list(rbind(
  c(103.773, 13.404), c(103.852, 13.404),
  c(103.852, 13.426), c(103.773, 13.426),
  c(103.773, 13.404)
))) |> st_sfc(crs = 4326)

east_baray <- st_polygon(list(rbind(
  c(103.890, 13.427), c(103.964, 13.427),
  c(103.964, 13.445), c(103.890, 13.445),
  c(103.890, 13.427)
))) |> st_sfc(crs = 4326)

leaflet() |>
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") |>
  setView(lng = 103.87, lat = 13.43, zoom = 12) |>
  addPolygons(data = west_baray,
              color = "#2980b9", weight = 3, fillOpacity = 0.2,
              popup = "<b>West Baray</b><br>7.8 × 2.1 km<br>Built: 11th c. CE<br>Still holds water") |>
  addPolygons(data = east_baray,
              color = "#e74c3c", weight = 3, fillOpacity = 0.2,
              popup = "<b>East Baray</b><br>7.5 × 1.83 km<br>Built: ~900 CE<br>Now dry") |>
  addMarkers(lng = 103.814, lat = 13.414,
             popup = "West Mebon Temple") |>
  addMarkers(lng = 103.926, lat = 13.435,
             popup = "East Mebon Temple (953 CE)") |>
  addMarkers(lng = 103.867, lat = 13.4125,
             popup = "Angkor Wat")
```
